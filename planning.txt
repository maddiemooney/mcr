ok it is time to PLAN

morse code detector thing using arduino
title MCR (morse code redundancy)

keyboard user input maybe command line to learn that
passes to arduino to translate to LED/laser blinking
photoresistor picks that up
translates back to morse code
(translates back to words?)
puts back on command line (maybe)

ok so should focus on the arduino part first (just the beeps and boops)
dot is (short amount of time)
dash is (longer, but still short amount of time)

i should find out the time stuff about the photoresistors i'm using
ordered:
 30 photoresistors 5mm 150 volts (max)  10 lux 
 10 laser boys 6mm 5 volts 

yeah there's a lot more to work on circuitry wise
heck

algorithm-wise tho things might be pretty good

letters are entered (however that may happen)
converts to dots and dashes
makes LED/laser blink for set period of time
photoresistor gets HIGH
starts timer
photoresistor gets LOW
ends timer
based on timer value, is either dot or dash
hmm. might need some sort of end signal.

also hysterisis. 
(https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/39942/measuring-time-between-two-photoresistors-and-printing-time-on-lcd) is a good link describing


values for photoresistor:
dark: 150k ohm
light 12.5k ohm
